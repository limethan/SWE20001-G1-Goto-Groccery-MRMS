The main goal of this project is to develop a member management system that is both efficient and effective for the GotoGro-MRMS. The system will include various functions that will help achieve the aforementioned requirements. For starters, the ability to manage membersâ€™ details and sales records is required, as well as having an analytical system that is able to identify grocery needs. These functions are required as it solves the underlying issues that the paper-based system currently has. For ease of use, the system will also feature a user-friendly interface and the capability to generate reports in a format that can be easily translated to CSV format for any further processing. All these functionalities will enhance the tracking of customers behaviour, ultimately improving aiding in better decision making around stock management and customer engagement.

Certain functionalities that are out of scope in this project include an online member portal, advanced AI-driven analytics and recommendations, a customer loyalty program, customer service and a stock management system. While these features add value to the project, they are not prioritized and thus not included in the current phase of development.
